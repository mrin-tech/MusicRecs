# Sound Soup by Mrinmoyee Mishra

Sound Soup is a website that enables Spotify users to generate fresh music recommendations from their top tracks. The user selects a track for which they would like to receive recommendations and specifies the desired metrics for the new songs, ranging from danceability to tempo to valence. Using the chosen track and metrics as a foundation, a playlist is created, comprising songs that align with the specified criteria. This playlist is then shared on the user's account.

The app is titled "The Sound Soup" because users are combining different elements (such as the seed tracks and slider values) and mixing them together to cook up brand-new music recommendations. It reminded me of the way we make soup by mixing different delicious ingredients to make a great meal. All the playlists generated have random soup names like "Minstrone", "Chicken Noodle", etc.
